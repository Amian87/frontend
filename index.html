<h1>Background</h1>

	<p>I&#39m a graduate of Starter School recently completing an internship at Public Good Software in Chicago, IL.
Prior to working in User Experience, I worked abroad in construction industry planning and sales. I&#39ve lived and worked in places outside of the United States and have seen the world from different perspectives. As a UX Designer, my work applies my multi-cultural outlook and entrepreneurial mindset to opportunities to create real value for users.
When I craft products, I believe that they should solve problems from the perspective of the user and augment their capabilities. I&#39m passionate about using technology to solve problems, and to continue designing compelling products and solutions.</p>
